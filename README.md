This course introduces students to the Software Engineering principles and practices of DevOps. DevOps helps companies to shorten development cycles and deliver higher quality products to customers more quickly by creating a culture of working together in a unified team, using automated processes throughout the product lifecycle, and focusing on continual improvement by monitoring and experimentation. Students will learn about the team culture, processes, technologies, and tools that enable successful DevOps teams to deliver better products faster. Prerequisites: Programming experience with Python, Java, or permission of the instructor.

## Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

* Identify the culture, principles, tools, and practices used by successful DevOps teams to deliver high quality functionality to customers
* Describe the needs of deployment and maintenance of software products beyond the development phase of a software project
* Summarize alternative software development lifecycles
* Implement configuration management, automated software testing, continuous integration and delivery, infrastructure as code, monitoring techniques and software container technologies in the AWS cloud computing environment
* Implement a small service using Docker containers on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform as part of a hands-on class project
* Apply Software Engineering life cycle principles to development projects

## List of Course Outcomes

* Name and describe the Three Ways: Flow, Feedback, and Continual Learning and Experimental and explain why they are important to succesful DevOps teams
* Summarize the strengths and weaknesses of Cloud architectures and technologies
* Apply tools to create an automated pipeline from software change through automated tests, continuous integration, and deployment
